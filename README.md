# B2G-UCSM
PHP Program that dynamically shares policy data between ACI controller and multiple UCSM domains.

The source php files are here, along with instructions for installing the pthreads library (this is multi-threaded) and the
required security libraries.

Alternatively, you can just email dan@hansoncrew.com to get a single .ova (to your dropbox or other location) as the 808MB
virtual appliance is not meant for github.

The .docx document has a complete set of instructions on the files if you wish to update items individually, or the as-built
device from the virtual appliance.

The actual php code is where things are done, and some attempt has been made to put inline documentation on what is happening.
